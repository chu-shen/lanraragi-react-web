**Warning**

This is for personal use, so some Chinese tags in the code are hard-coded.

Unless using Chinese tags, the tags should be modified to English version before use.

I haven't figured out how to solve it yet.

# Lanraragi React Web

A react based front-end application for making use of the [Lanraragi](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi) api. Works best on mobile and tablet viewports, but the desktop experience is okay.

## Features

- The app makes use of the Client API to interact with [LANraragi](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi) and get access to things like archive, thumbnails, images, categories, etc.

- Read archives (only tested .cbz/.zip files, other supported LRR file formats need testing) from your favorite web browsers on any device.

- Though the app can be run in the browser, for a better viewing experience, feel free to make use of the app's capabilities as a progressive web abb and download it on to your device for a cleaner experience without things like address bars or navigation buttons getting in the way.

## Installation

[Check out the wiki](https://github.com/hibikikuze4dan/lanraragi-react-web/wiki/Installation-and-Startup)

## Demo

[Demo Site](https://lanraragi-react-web.pages.dev/)

NOTE: If your Lanraragi content is being served from an http url, you will need to enable insecure content for the demo site and set the No-Fun Enabled setting to "Yes" in order to see images. This is due to how modern browsers deal with [mixed content issues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content#fixing_mixed_content_issues).
